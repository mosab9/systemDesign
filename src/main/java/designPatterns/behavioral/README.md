# Behavioral design patterns

## strategy pattern
Enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime. 
It defines a family of algorithms put them in a separate class, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. 
This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

## observer pattern
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. 
In this pattern, when one object (known as the subject or publisher) changes its state, 
all its dependents (known as observers or subscribers) are notified and updated automatically. 
The subject maintains a list of observers and provides methods for adding, 
removing, and notifying observers of state changes.


## command pattern

## template pattern

## visitor pattern
