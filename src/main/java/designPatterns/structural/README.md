# Structural Design Patterns:

structural design patterns are about how classes and objects can be composed to form larger structures.

## decorator pattern

Allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of 
other objects from the same class. It is used to extend or alter the functionality of objects at
runtime by wrapping them in an object of a decorator class.

## facade pattern
Provides a simplified interface to a complex framework or subsystem of classes, making it easier to use.

## adapter pattern
